Implementation of Some Algorithms to compute Edit Distance between two strings


      • The classic algorithm based on dynamic programming 
      • The pure recursive version 
      • A branch-and-bound version of the recursive approach 
      • An approximated version of the classical dynamic programming with only a stripe 
            of size k around the diagonal of the matrix
      • A version of combining dynamic programming and divide and conquer 
      • An approximated version based on a greedy approach
